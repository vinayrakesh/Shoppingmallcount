# Shoppingmallcount


### Project Overview
The "Shoppingmallcount" project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting and counting faces in a shopping mall environment. This project utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNN) to accurately recognize and count faces, helping in crowd management and analysis of foot traffic within mall areas. The project includes Jupyter notebooks for training and running the face detection models and a pre-trained model ready for deployment.

### Installation
To set up this project, follow these steps to create a suitable environment using Anaconda Navigator:
1. **Install Anaconda**: Download and install Anaconda from [Anaconda's website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
2. **Create a New Environment**:
    - Open Anaconda Navigator.
    - Go to the "Environments" tab.
    - Click on "Create".
    - Name your environment, e.g., `facecount`.
    - Choose Python version (preferably the version used in the notebooks, such as Python 3.8).
    - Click "Create".
3. **Activate and Install Packages**:
    - With the new environment selected, open a terminal from Anaconda Navigator.
    - Install necessary packages by running:
      ```bash
      pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python matplotlib
      ```
4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
    - Still in the "Environments" tab, click on the play button next to your environment.
    - Select "Open with Jupyter Notebook".
    - Navigate to the directory where you've stored the project files.

### File Descriptions
- `cnn_face.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook that outlines the process of training a CNN for face recognition.
- `face_detect.h5`: Saved model that contains the weights of the pre-trained face detection CNN.
- `face_detector.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook used to apply the face detection model to new images or video streams.
- `orginal.zip`: Contains additional data or scripts used by the notebooks. Extract this file to access its contents.

### Usage
To use this project, open the Jupyter notebooks (`cnn_face.ipynb` and `face_detector.ipynb`) in your Anaconda environment and follow the instructions within to train the model or run face detection on new data.
